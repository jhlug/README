This group is merely at the beginning stage and we are waiting for it to grow.

Contact:
1. discord ("JHU GNU/Linux User Group", one of the Johns Hopkins University servers). 
2. github issues for this repository (Yes ... we may abuse it a little bit as this group is still growing).

The [Tsinghua TUNA](https://tuna.moe/) club is our friend.
